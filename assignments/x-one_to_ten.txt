// Waipahu 2016

  Students practice and apply knowledge of conditionals, functions, data types and variables.

  Joelle's Notes: I had every intention of creating 10 functions  or conditionals =)

  One point for completing and pushing to github.

** Functions, Data types and Conditionals OH MAI

** Complete all exercises

/*
Lights Out
  create a variable named lights and set the value to a boolean
  create a conditional
    if the variable is true console.log('And then there was light')
    else console.log('Lights out')
*/

// --------------- //

/* Create ALL THE THINGS!
create the following variables
  hero with a string value
  gender with a string value
  age with a number value
  weapon with a string value
  pronoun with an empty value
  xp with an empty value
*/

/*
Create a conditional that sets the pronoun variable depending on the gender
  if Male/Guy/Boy, pronoun set to he
  if Female/Girl, pronoun set to she
  if potatoe, pronoun set to it

Create a conditional that sets xp variable to "it is just beginning" if age is less than 18.
  If their age is between 21 and 40 sets xp variable to "has seen a few battles"
  If their age is greater than 40 sets xp variable to "has lived through many epic battles"
*/

/*
Create the following sentece using your newly created variables:
  Anything in the brakets must be your variables.
"[Jake] is our lovable hero, who [has seen a few battles] with his trusty [sword]."
*/

// --------------- //

/*
1 Fish 2 Fish
  create a variable named count with no value
  create a variable named animal and set the variable to any animal as a string
  create a function name animalHouse that takes two parameters
  set the count variable to equal the sum of the two parameters
  console.log the count variable
  invoke animalHouse

1 Fish 2 Many Fish (cont.)
  create a conditional that checks the count variable
  check if the count is greater than 2
  console.log 'We have to many elephants' where the animal is the animal variable and an 's' added to the animal.
  if the first condition is false console.log 'Welcome to the club'
*/

// --------------- //

/*
Assemble the Avengers

  create a variable named ourHero and set the value to any avenger as a string
  create a function named avengersAssemble that takes one parameter avenger
    - inside the function create a conditional to check the parameter.
    - console.log and concat the parameter with a different message based on which avenger assembles if the condition is true
    - create four conditions, one for ironman, captain america, black widow and a default to console.log('Sorry, you are not needed for this mission')
    - example: if the avenger is Hulk -- console.log(avenger + 'smash');

  invoke avengersAssemble and pass the variable hero
